ttbin-java
==========

My Version of Reading TomToms Cardion Watch TTBin file format.

Basically a Java Port of
https://github.com/FluffyKaon/TomTom-ttbin-file-format.git

I did some of my own research but didn't get the tagged format right
the first time.

Usage
-----

./gradlew fatJar
java -jar build/libs/ttbin-all.jar <input ttbin file> <output gpx file>
